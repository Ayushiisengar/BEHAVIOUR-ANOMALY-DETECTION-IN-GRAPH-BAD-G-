# Behavioral Anomaly Detection in Graphs (BAD-G)

## Overview
BAD-G is a cutting-edge project that employs generative AI techniques to analyze dynamic graphs for behavioral anomalies. The goal is to detect unusual patterns in social or network graphs, enabling early detection of malicious activity, fraud, or unexpected behavior.

## Features
- **Dynamic Graph Analysis**: Monitors graph changes over time.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies irregular behavior patterns in nodes or edges.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Leverages generative models for enhanced prediction.
- **Customizable**: Adaptable for various applications like cybersecurity, fraud detection, and social network analysis.

## Applications
- Cybersecurity: Identify unusual behaviors in network traffic.
- Fraud Detection: Spot fraudulent transactions in financial systems.
- Social Behavior Analysis: Detect anomalous interactions in social networks.

## How It Works
1. **Graph Input**: Accepts dynamic graphs as input.
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Uses generative models to analyze node/edge interactions.
3. **Anomaly Identification**: Flags suspicious activities or outliers.
4. **Visualization**: Provides graphical outputs for anomaly representation.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS (for showcasing results)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **AI/ML Models**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar frameworks
- **Graph Library**: NetworkX or GraphFrames

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Behavioral-Anomaly-Detection-in-Graphs.git
